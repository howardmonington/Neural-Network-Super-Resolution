# Super Resolution

#### -- Project Status: [On-Hold]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to experiment with using neural networks to perform image super resolution. I first use the ESRGAN TensorFlow pretrained model. Then, I try building and training my own neural network. 


### Methods Used
* Neural Networks
* Image Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
